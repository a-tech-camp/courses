# Course
Here are the files that produce [github.com/a-tech-camp/one-repo].

## Contributing
To contribute to the project, create a pull request. Changes must be manually reviewed.

## Lesson
Lessons are sets of files belonging together. There are also two files that do not show up in the final lesson. They are `__message__.md` and` __commit__.ts` which are used in defining the structure of the commit. `__message__.md` contains the lesson content (or commit message) for a lesson. 

## Folders
The actual content is nested in folders. These folders allow for grouping of lessons into sub-units.

### [0-getting-started]
Early lessons that define broader context. These lessons will have a lot of their content in the commit message and markdown files as they won't.

The set of lessons in this group will result in a final lesson that aggregates the lessons and presents a good set of things that all repositories should have. This includes testing guidelines and dockerfiles.

### [1-coding]
The coding folder has the content related to languages. These files will teach you how to work with the languages fundamentals.

### [2-math]
Some prerequisites are abstract ideas. Things like graphs can be explained separately from it's implementation. Work in Progress (WIP)

### [3-coding-sandbox]
Coding Sandbox files require a different set of getting started files. The first commit will be going through the UI to create a template project. So the aggregate lesson is very small and different from language lessons.

## Philosophy
In learning it is always good to keep returning to the fundamentals. [Coding Kata's](google.com/search?q=code+kata) is the process of repeatedly implementing small projects for practice. The lessons in this folder should

### Fundamental Unit of Code
Each lesson should feel like a fundamental unit of code/
