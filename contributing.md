# Contributing

A `contributing` file will specify how to contribute to a repository.

## Student Branches
Students will create a branch the follows the pattern `<name>/master` which will be the students personal master branch. This branch should have the tag `Student`

There will be one Pull Request to merge in `<name>/master` which will be a great way of seeing a student's progress in the branch

When working on an assignment, a student will create a pr that merges in their new branch `<name>/<assignment>` into `<name>/master`

## Master
Contributions to master should be tagged with the `Master` tag to make it apparent that they need review.

## Tags
 - `Master` merging into master to update the class
 - `Student` student branch merging into master, but should not be merged/ update class
 - `Assignment` assignment branch merging into the student master
