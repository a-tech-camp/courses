# Graphs

A graph is a simple way to describe many-to-many relationships. The two elements in a graph are it's nodes and edges. An edge is defined a connection of nodes (usually 2).

## Nodes
A node can be any singular thing. 

## Edges
An edge symbolizes a connection between nodes (often just 2).

## Definition
### Adjacency List
Our graph has nodes. Each node has a set of neighbors. That set of neighbors specifies it's edges
