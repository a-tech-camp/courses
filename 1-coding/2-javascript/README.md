# Javascript

Javascript, like python is a high-level programming language. It's the primary language of web-frameworks and server side languages written in node.js

It can be more accurately described as a collection of languages as the exact syntax that is allowed depends heavily on the environment we are running our code in. 

## ECMA
European Computer Manufacturers Association has its own coding language called ECMAScript. Javascript is based off of ECMAscript. 

## Mozilla
The Mozilla Foundation is the forefront community on all things javascript. They are responsible for the FireFox Browser as well as the most extensive documentation of the javascript community.

They have fantastic resources and will be often mentioned. 

[Getting Started](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
 - The Tutorials section on thee left hand side has a great series. I recommend picking one of the groups Complete beginners, JavaScript Guide, Intermediate, or Advanced and going through 3 assignments

## index.js
Like README, index.js is the most generic name for a javascript file.
