# Fundamentals

This folder goes through the basic building blocks of javascript projects.

## Statements

The fundamental unit of code is a statement. Statements can exist within blocks of code, where they are surrounded by `{ }` and they are seperated by `;`. Sometimes these characters can be infered but it's good practice to include them

Examples:
```js
callFunctions();
const variable = 1;


if (true) {
    console.log("is True");
} else {
    console.log("is False")
}
```
