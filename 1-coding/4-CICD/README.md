# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

CICD is a dev-ops, or developer operations, process for first testing and then releasing code. Here we work on a set of configurations and specifications. Ideally, we have as much of our work done via code. Thus we can version control the code.

]We want version controlled code. This comes from our desire for deterministic systems. Determininistic code results in the same output for common input. This code is easier to debug as it is easier to reproduce errors. Moreso, if we have validated errors do not exists, that should continue to do so.

## Configuration as Code
We may think of coding as an active activity where we make things happen. In a lot of dev-ops tools as well as a lot of high level languages
