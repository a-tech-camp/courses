# Map
Instead of iterating through a list manually, we can map through the elements of that list. 

A map will take the element of a list and perform a function on that element and return the result. 

Here that function takes the name and puts it into a paragraph tag (`name => <p>{name}</p>`). The `{}` signifies the escape of r
