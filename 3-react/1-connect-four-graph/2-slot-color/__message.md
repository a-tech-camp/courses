# Slot Color
We want to be able to set the slot color to be dependent on the current player.

We combine our work done in creating a slot a with our work changing a player turn.

Then, we create css definitions for coloring in those slots.

Instead of our button being responsible for the change in player, we can assign this to our slot.
