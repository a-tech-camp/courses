# Graphs

A graph is a simple way to describe many-to-many relationships. The two elements in a graph are it's nodes and edges. An edge is defined a connection of nodes (usually 2).

## Nodes
A node can be any singular thing. 

## Edges
An edge symbolizes a connection between nodes (often just 2).

## Defining graphs
There are many ways to define the same graph. Each of them comes with it's own set of trade-offs

### List of Edges
Our graphs is comprised of a series of edges. This is a common way of storing a graph in a database.

### Adjacency List
Our graph has nodes. Each node has a set of neighbors. That set of neighbors specifies it's edges

### Matrix 
A matrix is a two dimensional array of n elements on each side.
